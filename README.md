**This is my fork of SpriteBuilder that I used to help me create App Fall - The Game and I currently am using to help me develop new games that are currently in development.**

SpriteBuilder is the first game development suite for rapidly building native iOS and Android games with Objective-C and Xcode. SpriteBuilder is free and open source (MIT licensed) and available for download in the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spritebuilder/id784912885?mt=12).
